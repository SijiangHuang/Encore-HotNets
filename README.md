# Datacenter Network Deserves Better Traffic Models (HotNets'23)

This repository hosts the code accompanying our paper, "Datacenter Network Deserves Better Traffic Models," presented at HotNets 2023. Our paper introduces new methodologies for modeling and generating traffic in datacenter networks. These methodologies aim to create more accurate and realistic models, which are crucial for better design and testing of datacenter network architectures.

Currently, this repository provides the code necessary for the traffic modeling and generation techniques described in our paper. Upon the completion of the extended version of Encore, we will update this repository with code covering the entire process of traffic modeling and performance evaluation.
